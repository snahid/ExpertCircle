                    <h2>About Experts Circle</h2>
                    <p>The recruitment process has been the same for decades, unchanged and unchallenged. But what if there was a better way? What if we could empower experts in each field to hand-pick the candidates they know are best for the job?<br/> 
                        Instead of relying on traditional recruiters who don’t have any understanding of your specific business, consider the possibilities of recruiting via a verified expert: someone who knows exactly what you need.

                    <p>There is a huge force of experts with solid qualifications and years of experience in a wide variety of sectors; most of these experts also have an extensive network of professional connections.<br/> 
                        At Experts Circle, we’re providing a platform to empower these experts to act as recruiters, using their knowledge, skills, and connections to create perfect matches between jobs and candidates. Employers can fill vacancies faster, and they can feel secure in the knowledge that their new employees have been screened, vetted, and verified by experts who understand the necessary hard and soft skills: experts who have those skills themselves.<br/>
                        In addition, our experts earn additional income through their recruiting activities. For every match made, the platform keeps just a small percentage of the fee. The rest goes to the expert recruiter and the candidate, so everybody wins.

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Experts Circle started with the innovative vision and hard-earned experience of our founder. Our story is ultimately his story.</p>
            <div class="our-story-inner">
                <div class="our-story-left">
                    <img src="./assets/images/about/our-story-img.svg" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="our-story-right">
                    <div class="story-para">
                        <div class="quote">
                            <i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                        </div>
                        <p>“When I first started contracting, I lost a substantial amount of money to a dishonest recruiter who used the corporate structure to embezzle money from his clients. When this was discovered, he closed his Limited company and started another one in a different name doing exactly the same thing again. The stress of it all stayed with me and influenced my thinking as my career progressed.</p>
                            <p>
                            I later experienced recruiters running phishing scams. I found agencies who were genuine but who had little or no experience with their clients’ businesses or needs. I was put forward by recruiters for jobs when I was completely unsuitable for the position, because the recruiters either didn’t understand what was required, or they didn’t care. Recruiters often put candidates forward for positions — and I have been in this situation myself — when they simply do not have the hard or soft skills required.</p>
                           <p> 
                            I’ve even worked in recruitment myself with some of Europe’s largest jobs boards, and I know how hard it can be to find the right candidate for the job: the person with the necessary hard and soft skills. Not only does someone need to have the technical know-how, but that person also needs to be able to fit comfortably into that specific work environment’s culture and mindset. It can be a real challenge.</p>
                            <p>
                            That’s why I started Experts Circle. I wanted to give employers and experts the chance to work together to match candidates to positions in the best possible way, and I wanted to replace the broken recruitment model with one that really works. Very few people trust recruitment agents; let’s change that. Let’s make recruitment work.”
